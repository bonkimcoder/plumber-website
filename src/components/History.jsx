          Prime Construct was founded with a simple mission: to provide
          reliable, high-quality plumbing services to homes and businesses
          across Kenya. Starting as a small family-run business, weâ€™ve grown
          steadily over the years, building a reputation for excellence,
          professionalism, and trust. With over 10 years of experience in the
          industry, we have expanded our services to cover everything from
          residential repairs to large-scale commercial installations. Our
          passion for delivering exceptional service and solving complex
          plumbing issues has made us a leader in the industry, and we continue
          to serve our community with the same dedication and expertise that has
          driven us from the beginning.
